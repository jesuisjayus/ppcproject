### Project Description

This teamwork was carried out within the framework of the PPC project (___P___*rogrammation* ___P___*arallèle et* ___C___*oncurrente*, parallel and concurrent programming) taught in the telecommunication department of INSA Lyon. 


The aim of this project is to learn the basics of parallel and concurrent programming and to produce a functional program.

We had to create program that simulate an energy market that deal with homes. Find more details [here](https://github.com/jesuisjayus/ppcproject/blob/a8e2e1c8680b14c3dc53e457db0db61803565f57/PPC%20projectc%20-%20The%20Energy%20Market%20-%202023.pdf "ppcprject proposal").

### How to run and use the program 

0. First, make sure python is installed on your device (if not, check this [page](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
1. Download the code and unzip it
2. Open a terminal in the folder and type `python3 energy_market.py`
3. The simulation is running !
4. You can stop it whenever you want by pressing CTRL and C keys. 

#### Notable details : 
* coded and tester under Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* it seems that sysv_ipc packet doesn't work on windows :(
